# A "Tribute" Page?

* This is the second project of the Responsive Web Design
at [freecodecamp](https://freecodecamp.org).

* I don't exactly know how to do a tribute, so I just ended
up writing a fictional history... he he...

* About the truth? Who knows someday I polish the history
and end up by revealing the truth...

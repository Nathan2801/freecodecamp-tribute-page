                Samoel was the most common old man you would
                ever see in your life, at the same time he was
                a great water bottle flipper.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Born at 1950 in England, he was forced to work since 12
                to help his family survive, at 1969 he discovered his most
                brillant talent, at 1000 bottle flip he was able to success
                in 998, at the time this ability was not considered
                important which make people laught at him, and ask him
                why to waste so much time just flipping bottles.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                At 1999 he was able to do something never seen before, he
                managed to successfully flip 6 water bottles at the same
                time! At the time no one could stand against him when the
                subject is bottle flipping, he was exceptional.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                But time has come, his wife <em>Josefa Alencar</em>,
                had been captured by bad guys, they required <em>Samoel</em>
                to pay &euro; 1.000.000 if he wanted to see her again, how
                <em>Samoel</em> would get &euro; 1.000.000? He had a genius
                idea, he would get to the location and impress every bad guy
                with his unappreciated talent! This would make they see how
                talented <em>Samoel</em> is and let his wife go.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                At the location, <em>Samoel</em> called every bad guy to
                see his ability, they became so impressed, everything was
                going as planend, but the <em>big bad guy</em>, didn't happy
                with such performance offered a deal, if he was able to
                win against his 9 y.o. son at bottle flip, his wife would
                be free, otherwise, they both would meet the death, without
                options <em>Samoel</em> accepted.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                His son appeared from the shadows, he was wearing student
                clothes, and by looking at him, anyone would say he is the
                smartest boy in the school, without saying nothing he throw
                a water bottle in a table 10 meters await from him,
                <em>Samoel</em> was impressed but he needed to stay calm!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The fight began, the boy did ballet moves while throwing
                bottles, every throw was perfect, it was really something
                out of the world, as <em>Samoel</em> saw it, he had little
                hope of getting out of this with life... to beat this boy
                he had to try the most dangerous bottle flip of all time,
                <em>The deadly bloody bottle flip of death.</em>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                He took the knife of one of the bad guys and was ready
                for the moviment, he threw the knife up, he threw the
                water bottle up and he used all his strength in it's old
                body to make a backflip, the time seemed to slow down,
                everyone with their mouth wide open to this scene,
                <em>Samoel</em>, saw all his life throught his eyes,
                all the bad times, all the good times, and all the bottles
                he never flipped... When he thought about all bottles he
                didn't flip, he knew, it's not his time yet, he had to
                flip a lot more of bottles, and then he found him self in
                the ground.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The bottle has perfectly above his head, he did make it!
                But had a miscalculation in the knife weight, instead of
                reaching the top of the bottle, it's reachs the side,
                cutting the side of the bottle in a half, and reaching
                <em>Samoel's</em> head, everything goes black...
            </p>

                What happened after... No one knows... Except me... Do
